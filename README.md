DynamoDB Modeling Workshop

### Intro
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database 
designed to run your high-performance applications at any scale.

Customers bringing existing key-value or relational data into DynamoDB 
have an opportunity to refactor and restructure data into formats optimal for 
NoSQL database access patterns.

In this workshop we will review different NoSQL data structures using the NoSQL Workbench.


### Setup Steps

 * Open the [model.json](./model.json) file within the NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB.
 * Deploy the five tables into your AWS account.
